# Research
Open research questions for the [system language](https://github.com/system-language/SL) (SL) project.

1. How can [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org) be used to implement an initial demonstration of SL? What can be learned from the [Active Blockference](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/ActiveBlockference) project's cadCAD implementation?

2. How can [Generalized Dynamical Systems](https://medium.com/block-science/generalized-dynamical-systems-part-i-foundations-74505bbdf0e#:~:text=Generalized%20Dynamical%20Systems%20(GDS)%20is,be%20found%20in%20Token%20Engineering.) (GDS) be effectively integrated with SL? SL focuses on providing a structure for holding all relevant the details of a system while GDS focuses on modeling the dynamics of a system over time. 

3. What open-source tools can be used to develop the GUI component? Is [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) a good candidate?



# Systems of Interest

### Cryptoeconomic Systems
The [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.github.io/beaconrunner/notebooks/beaconrunner/br.html) and [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/towards-computer-aided-governance-of-gitcoin-grants) have used cadCAD for mission critical simulations.

We want to make this sort of modelling more intuitive and accessible for those without deep programming expertise.
